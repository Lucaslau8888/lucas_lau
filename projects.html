            <h2>Mindlink Groups Website</h2>

          <div class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">
This project was completed during my NYP internship, where I focused on enhancing the company’s website, which was built on the Odoo platform. The development involved working with technologies such as <b>Python</b> for backend logic, <b>XML</b> for view customization, and <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Bootstrap</b> for frontend design and interactivity. One of the main features I created was the agent management system, which allows administrators to manage agent information efficiently. It also includes a function to generate digital business cards for each agent, enabling them to use these e-cards for professional purposes.

<br><br>

Another important feature I developed was the e-submit system. Unlike the traditional submission method, this feature allows employees to submit documents directly through the website. Employees are required to fill in relevant information, such as pricing details, and submit it to the admin. The admin then verifies the data to ensure its accuracy before passing the information to the invoicing module. This improves the submission workflow and minimizes the risk of human error.
<br><br>

The third feature I implemented was calendar integration. When a submission involves a rental agreement, a calendar reminder is automatically created. This is especially helpful for agents who manage multiple rental transactions, as it eliminates the need to manually record each deadline. The system not only records the dates but also reminds agents when rental contracts are approaching their deadlines.

            <h2>I@FAD - AI Feed Dispenser</h2>

          <div class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">
During my Final Year Project at Nanyang Polytechnic, I worked on a project called <b>I@FAD – Development of an Intelligent Aquatic Feed Dispenser to Increase Productivity</b>. The purpose of the project was to make fish feeding automatic using <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b>. This helps fish farmers save time and effort, while also making sure the fish are fed properly and consistently.

<br><br>

My role was to improve the AI system so it could detect <b>fish food (pellets)</b> more accurately. I collected and prepared many <b>images of the pellets</b> to train the AI and tested it to make sure it could work well in different conditions, such as changes in lighting or water clarity. This helped the system become more reliable and ready for use in real fish farms.
              <br><br>

I also created a <b>user-friendly website</b> using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> that allows users to control the feeding system without needing any coding knowledge. Through the website, users can easily set <b>feeding times</b> and <b>limits</b> to stop feeding when too much food is detected. This makes the system more accessible and efficient for employees. Additionally, I developed a <b>graph feature</b> using <b>JavaScript libraries</b> like <b>Chart.js</b> that allows administrators to visualize feeding activity over time, helping them review patterns and spot any unusual behavior. The system also sends <b>email alerts</b> using <b>Python</b> and <b>SMTP</b> if it detects a consistent drop in feeding activity.

            <h2>Packet tracer project</h2>

          <div class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">
This project was created during my higher Nitec years, the main purpose of this project was to focus on implementing VPNs and firewalls, preventing cyber attacks, providing confidentiality by establishing a secure connection, monitoring the incoming packets and blocking unauthorized access. My role in this project was to install and configure the Firewall and router.
<br><br>
One challenge I encountered during this project was that after the configuration of the firewall and router, the network traffic slowed down considerably, resulting in a delay in the process of data transfer.

              <br><br>As this was my first time encountering this problem and the school had not yet taught us ways to solve this type of problem, I had to discuss it with my project mates and research online to find the root cause of the problem and solutions to address it. It was not easy to find the root cause of the issue but due to my group's teamwork as well as my perseverance, I was able to solve the problem which lead to the router running smoothly. Overall, this project has allowed me to gain more insight into how the network data exchanges and interacts.

            <h2>Window OS hardening</h2>

          <div class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">
This project was created during my higher Nitec years. It focuses on how to increase the security level of end devices and provide reliable connection within a network by using a firewall, antivirus software and setting configuration. High-level security plays a vital role in the industry as it can prevent unauthorized access as well as cyber-attacks. My role in this project was to configure end devices for companies to enhance their network security.

<br><br>

However, there are various types of end devices and all of them possess different specifications. It was challenging to configure different types of end devices as I needed to be meticulous in the configuring their settings. This was important as configuring the settings wrongly could result in lag. I was able to overcome this challenge by memorizing the different requirements for end devices specifications as well as exposing myself to the various types of end devices. Overall, the project was successful due to the persistent effort I put in to overcome the challenge.
