          <div class="desc">
During my three-month internship at Ming Yan Company, I focused on improving the company’s website, which was built using the Odoo platform. I contributed to enhancing existing features and optimizing the overall user experience. One of the key features I developed was the Agent Management module, which allows the company to manage staff information efficiently. Additionally, I created the E-Submit function, enabling users to submit documents and automatically generate e-receipts. These enhancements significantly improved the effectiveness and efficiency of the company’s internal processes.

Working at Challenger has allowed me to gain many new experiences and knowledge that was not taught in school. Hands-on experiences such as troubleshooting and basic configuration of devices have enabled me to deepen my understanding and further build on the foundation of what I have learned in school. Other than these hard skills, I also acquired soft skills such as communication through customer support throughout my days working at Challenger.          </div>
