        <p>I am a responsible and motivated individual who is always keen to expand my
            skill set and gain new experiences. Moreover, I am adept at getting across to
            people and adapting to changes with ease. I also believe that good interpersonal
            skills and working well in a team are crucial in broadening one's horizon. Furthermore,
            I am well organized and always plan ahead to manage my time well. Taking the initiative to
            solve problems without being asked has always been my strength.</p>
