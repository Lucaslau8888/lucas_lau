  <p>
    I am a responsible and motivated individual who is always keen to expand my skill set and
    gain new experiences. Moreover, I am adept at getting across to people and adapting to
    changes with ease. I also believe that good interpersonal skills and working well in a team
    are crucial in broadening one's horizon. Furthermore, I am well-organized and always plan ahead
    to manage my time well. Taking the initiative to solve problems without being asked has always been
    my strength.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to my core strengths, I have developed a strong interest in programming and technology.
    The languages I focus on include <b><u>Node.js</u></b> for backend development, <b><u>Jinja</u></b> for templating in Python-based
    applications, <b><u>HTML</u></b> and <b><u>CSS</u></b> for building web interfaces, and <b><u>JavaScript</u></b> for creating interactive and dynamic
    content. I also place great importance on <b><u>UX design</u></b> to ensure that websites are user-friendly, visually appealing,
    and intuitive to navigate. Additionally, I have explored basic <b><u>networking</u></b>, which has given me a solid foundation in understanding
    how devices and networks communicate.
</p>

<p>
    I am always eager to learn more and apply my knowledge in real-world projects, while also growing as a versatile
    and adaptive problem solver.
